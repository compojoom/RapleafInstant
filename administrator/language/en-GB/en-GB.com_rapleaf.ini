COM_RAPLEAF_NONE_AGE_CRITERIA_MET="Your members seem to be distributed fairly evenly amongst the different age groups. Not one age group has a larger share of 25%. Unless your offering is quite general, it may become challenging to appeal to all age groups long-term."
COM_RAPLEAF_CRITERIA_AGE_18_20="The largest part of your members are between 18 and 20, claiming over a quarter of the memberships on your site with %s. A young audience can mean that new features and other advancements may become accepted easier, but on the otherhand, this age group generally has the least spending power. Their spending habits tend to focus on personal appearance, entertainment and education."
COM_RAPLEAF_CRITERIA_AGE_21_24="The largest part of your members are between 21 and 24, claiming over a quarter of the memberships on your site with %s. This age group consists of young adults, which are either still pursuing a higher degree or just entering the workforce. In some countries like the USA entering this age group grants you more privileges in society, such as consuming alcohol. The spending power of this age group is somewhat higher than the 18-20 group, because more people tend to enter the working world in this stage of their life."
COM_RAPLEAF_CRITERIA_AGE_25_34="The largest part of your members are between 25 and 34, claiming over a quarter of the memberships on your site with %s. This age group is generally made up of young families, aspiring professionals and workers that have been gaining experience in their field for a few years now. Generally having busier lifestyles than other age groups, their spending is focused stronger on services and transportation. Spending on housing and food is similarly important to young families."
COM_RAPLEAF_CRITERIA_AGE_35_44="The largest part of your members are between 35 and 44, claiming over a quarter of the memberships on your site with %s. The members of this age group tend to have growing families and become house owners. Their spending shifts focus to family and housing, this includes entertainment for the whole family and children at different ages."
COM_RAPLEAF_CRITERIA_AGE_45_54="The largest part of your members are between 45 and 54, claiming over a quarter of the memberships on your site with %s. This age group is generally concerned with grown up children, educational expenditures, expansion of the living environment as well as saving for retirement."
COM_RAPLEAF_CRITERIA_AGE_55_64="The largest part of your members are between 55 and 64, claiming over a quarter of the memberships on your site with %s. This age group tends to have the highest spending power with children out of the house and college, and potentially starting their own careers. New decoration, landscaping, travel, cars and insurance are some of the spending focuses of this age group."
COM_RAPLEAF_CRITERIA_AGE_65="The largest part of your members are over 65, claiming over a quarter of the memberships on your site with %s. This is highly unusual as older members of society tend to be less computer literate, which will soon change after all living generations are used to using computers. This age group spends the most money on health and maintaining what they own. The older a senior gets, the higher the probability that he will spend more money on home-services."
COM_RAPLEAF_GENDER_ANALYSIS_LESS_THAN_30="Less than 30% of your members are female. If your products or services are geared mostly towards men, then this is not an issue. But if you were expecting a higher percentage of female members, then you should consider working on your strategy to target female audiences. (A female copywriter for example)"
COM_RAPLEAF_GENDER_ANALYSIS_31_49="Less than half of your members are female, with a %s share of your memberships. This is not unusual and means that you have a fairly diversified offering on your site. If that is not the case, try to cater better to the gender you are aiming your products and services at."
COM_RAPLEAF_GENDER_ANALYSIS_51_69="More than half of your site members are female, with %s share of your memberships. Try to aim your rhetoric, products and services towards women and you may see an increase in sales."
COM_RAPLEAF_GENDER_ANALYSIS_MORE_THAN_70="A very large amount of your audience is female, which is quite unusual on the internet. If your site does not aim mainly at female members, then you should! Offer products and services that women are interested in. Don't wait. "
COM_RAPLEAF_MOOTOOLS12_IS_NOT_ACTIVATED="Rapleaf is not going to function properly! Mootools 1.2 is not activated. You need to activate the mootools upgrade plugin(available since Joomla 1.5.19). <a href='%s'>Click here</a> to go to plugin manager."

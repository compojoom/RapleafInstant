	Rapleaf is a company that builds innovative products to compile and analyze large amounts of information.
	</p>
	<p>
		This plugin offers their ability to analyze these large amounts inside 
		joomla to effortlessly compile a report about your site's demographics. <br />
		The current version will provide you with Age, Gender and Location. 
		You will be able to get more in-depth data about your members right inside <br />
		joomla in future versions or you can contact Rapleaf right away. <br />
		In order to run an analysis of your userbase, your name (not the username), 
		your domain and email address will be submitted when creating reports. <br />
		This saves you the time of creating an account and obtaining your own API key.

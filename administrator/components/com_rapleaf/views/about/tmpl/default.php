		<a href="https://www.rapleaf.com" target="_blank">Rapleaf</a> is a company that builds innovative products to compile and analyze large amounts of information.
	</p>
	<p style="width: 450px;">
		This plugin offers <a href="https://www.rapleaf.com/how_it_works" target="_blank">Rapleaf's ability</a> to analyze these large amounts inside
		joomla to effortlessly compile a report about your site's demographics. 
		The current version will provide you with Age, Gender and Location. 
		You will be able to get more in-depth data about your members right inside
		joomla in future versions or you can contact Rapleaf right away. 
		In order to run an analysis of your userbase, your name (not the username),
		your domain and email address will be submitted when creating reports. 
		This saves you the time of creating an account and obtaining your own API key.
